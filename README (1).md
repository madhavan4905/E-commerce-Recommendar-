# 💡 E-commerce Recommender System

This is an internship project developed under **YBI Foundation**, focusing on building a **recommender system** using collaborative filtering for an e-commerce platform.

---

## 📌 Objective

To recommend products to users based on their purchase behavior using **User-Based** and **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** techniques.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Numpy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
